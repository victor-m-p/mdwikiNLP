### Details

1. Your poster should explain the goal of your project, describe your datatsets and methodology used, and summarize any results (so far). 

Note: Your project is not expected to be in finished form! The poster session is a great chance to get feedback for the final synposis.

2. Use a poster template. I recommend the [Better Scientific Poster](https://osf.io/ef53g/). You can find design ideas on Twitter with hashtag \#betterposters. 
3. Save your poster as a pdf and email to rbkh@cc.au.dk by **Mon December 9 at 11am**. 
4. Posters will be printed in bulk on-campus in size A1 (equivalent to eight standard A4 sheets of paper). This is a smaller poster format, so please make sure your fonts are big enough! 
5. Come to your poster session 20 min early to get your poster and set up.
