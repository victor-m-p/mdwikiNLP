If you are finished before the rest of the class you will have some time to work on the following questions. This will be a bit though, especially if you haven't done too much python before, don't be scared we will go through it. 

This is a good exercise to look at code written by someone else and take from it what you like and what you dislikes. While doing the exercises consider what makes it hard to read and what makes it easy to understand. If you are an experienced programmer feel free to just examine the code at your own pace.


1) Please take a look at the *structure* script (it is available on element and facebook). Refrain from looking into functions for now. You need to be able to answer the following when done:

      1) It is a long-comment string (if that is what is referred to).
   2) Where is external code loaded in
   3) What does the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section do?
   4) Where is code run?
2) Next up, simply run the code try to run it in section to se what each line does
3) Next we will examine the functionality a bit more closely
